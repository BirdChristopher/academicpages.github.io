# About Me
I am currently a first year master student at the School of Software & Microelectronics, Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. Bin Cui. I received my bachelor's degree in School of Software, Beihang University in 2023.6.
  
I am looking forward to make contribution to the progress of Machine Learning System, and I am recently learning about it.
